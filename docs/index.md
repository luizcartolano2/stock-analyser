This site contains the project documentation for the
`stock-analyser`. Its aim is to give you a server that retrieves information
from stock exchanges using multiple providers and also doing analyses for these.

## Table Of Contents

The documentation follows the best practice for
project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [Diátaxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. [How-To Guides](how-to-guides.md)
2. [Reference](reference.md)

Quickly find what you're looking for depending on
your use case by looking at the different pages.

## Acknowledgements

I want to extend my sincerest gratitude to our steadfast office plants, 
for silently witnessing our triumphs, failures, and occasional office drama
without ever leafing us hanging. To the coffee machine, for being the unsung hero
of our productivity and for always perking us up, one cup at a time. 
A huge shoutout to my patient family and friends, who have perfected the
art of nodding along to our techno-babble without skipping a beat. 
And last but not least, a heartfelt thank you to the internet – for 
being our reliable co-pilot through the highs and lows of this project, 
and for providing endless cat videos during those much-needed breaks. 
Without all of you, this endeavor would have been as futile as trying to find a 
`Ctrl + Alt + Delete` button on a typewriter.
